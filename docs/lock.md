You've now successfully locked a Prodigy account- it can't be accesed again!
Try logging in then joining a world- haha, not possible!

## Unlocking
1. Log into Prodigy, but don't join a world
2. Wait for cheatGUI to load.
3. `[Hack] Set Level` => 100 
4. Try joining a world. If it didn't work, reload and try again.

You've now successfully unlocked a Prodigy account- hopefully!
Good luck!
