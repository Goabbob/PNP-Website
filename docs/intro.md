## History of ProdigyPNP

On April 6, 2022, [Prodigy-Hacking/ProdigyMathGameHacking](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking/ProdigyMathGameHacking) and [Prodigy-Hacking/P-NP](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking/P-NP) were deleted due to a DMCA takedown. P-NP technically hosts a copy of Prodigy's code, except it's modified to allow the running of hacks. [PHEx](https://github.com/ProdigyPNP/ProdigyMathGameHacking/tree/master/PHEx) was [taken off the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gjabpajagbgoifbkflgojeojmnlmioea). This was the fall of Prodigy-Hacking. That organization would never return to hack Prodigy ever again.

However, this was not at all the end for Prodigy Hacks. Just a day after Prodigy-Hacking's end, [gemsvid√∏](https://github.com/afkvido) created the GitHub organization [ProdigyPNP](https://github.com/ProdigyPNP), with [donaldli](https://github.com/donaldli2020) and [Eris](https://github.com/Erisfiregamer1). After a little more than a week of work on fixing P-NP and PHEx to be compatible with ProdigyPNP's links and services, ProdigyPNP had officially brought back PHEx.
